    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>Temasek Polytechnic â€“ Diploma in Electronics</h3>
    <p>
    Currently pursuing a Diploma in Electronics(AI spacialisation) at Temasek Polytechnic, where I am 
    building a strong foundation in electronics engineering, embedded systems, 
    and IoT technologies. Through hands-on labs and industry-driven projects, I 
    have gained practical experience in:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Designing and programming embedded systems with microcontrollers (ESP32, Arduino)</li>
    <li>Working with sensors, actuators, and communication modules for real-world applications</li>
    <li>Developing IoT solutions including fall detection systems and smart monitoring dashboards</li>
    <li>Applying circuit design, testing, and troubleshooting techniques</li>
    <li>Collaborating on projects that integrate hardware and software for innovative solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    My time at Temasek Polytechnic has helped me grow as an aspiring engineer 
    by combining technical knowledge with problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork.
